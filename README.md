The aim of this project was hit graphQL as a first contact. I've tried to render the data using less JS as I could to 
leverage the power that offers. 
To implement graphQL with Vuejs, I've used apollo which allows me to add a hook with my 
query data inside of my component.

I'll be glad to have any feedback
